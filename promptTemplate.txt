ROLE: You act as a football analyst, betting tipster and an expert in article writing.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Prepare an article discussing the following:
    - The rank of the two teams in the standings. Data: {homeTeam} is in place number {homeTeamRank}({homeTeamRankStatus}) in standings with {homeTeamPoints} points. {awayTeam} is in place number {awayTeamRank}({awayTeamRankStatus}) in standings with {awayTeamPoints} points. Note: Do not mention the amount of fixtures or anything else. Just mention the ranks and points.
    - The recent form of both teams and how it influences their chances of winning. Data: {homeTeam}:{homeTeamForm}. {awayTeam}:{awayTeamForm}
    - head to head between the two teams only in the prediction paragraph. Data: {head2head}
    - The average goals scored and conceded for {homeTeam} in home. Data: {homeTeamGoalsStats}. 
    - The average goals scored and conceded for {awayTeam} in away matches. Data: {awayTeamGoalsStats}.
    - How xG(expected goals) values reflect the likely goals and goals opportunities in the match. Note: Expected goals measures the quality of a chance by calculating the likelihood that it will be scored by using information on similar shots in the past. Expected goals value refers to all the team games and not specifically home or away games. Data: {homeTeam}-{homeXG}, {awayTeam}-{awayXG}.
    - The potential impact of injuries or key player absences on team performance. Data: {homeTeam}: {homeTeamSidelinedPlayers}. {awayTeam}: {awayTeamSidelinedPlayers}
2. The match prediction based ONLY on the provided data.
3. Conclude with a prediction about the match possible outcome and justify the answer with a short summarization of the provided data.
4. The only headings of the article should be the two teams discussion paragraphs and the prediction paragraph.
5. Prepare the text in html format with H3 headings with team names and the prediction paragraph (eg "TeamA", "TeamB" and "Prediction") and line breaks after the end of each section. The text should be three paragraphs. A paragraph of the home team statistics discussion, a paragraph of the away team statistics discussion, and a prediction paragraph with h3 header "Prediction".
6. Write around 500 words making reason from the provided data.   
7. At the very end of the text there should be a field "Prediction:" with the final outcome(1, X or 2) in <strong> html tags. For example "<strong>Prediction: 1</strong>"(home team win), "<strong>Prediction: X</strong>"(draw), or "<strong>Prediction: 2</strong>"(away team win).

EXPECTATIONS:
I expect a result in the format of the following example:

<h3>Manchester City</h3>
[A paragraph with the discussion for Manchester City statistics (rank, form, goals statistics, xG, and absences)]

<h3>Chelsea</h3>
[A paragraph with the discussion for Chelsea statistics (rank, form, goals statistics, xG, and absences)]

<h3>Prediction</h3>
[A paragraph summarizing all the data discussed along with head to head statistics and concluding with the prediction]

<strong>Prediction: X</strong>
